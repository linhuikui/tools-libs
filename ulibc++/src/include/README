Include files for ULib, external users.

They're all placed in the ulib subdirectory here for better fit in any kind
of environment. You should include files from here using...

#include <ulib/string.h>

... style and point the compiler's include path to the directory holding the
ulib subdirectory. It makes it more likely to survive future modifications.
